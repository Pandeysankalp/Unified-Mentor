# Olympics Data Analysis
## Overview
This project is part of the Olympics Data Analysis at Unified Mentor. The primary objective is to explore and analyze the dataset related to the Olympic Games over the years, identify trends, and uncover insights related to athletes, countries, and sports. We use machine learning, SQL, and data manipulation techniques, along with various data visualization tools to analyze the dataset.

### Tools and Technologies Used
### Python (with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
### Machine Learning (for predictive modeling and insights)
### SQL (for querying and data extraction)
### Excel (for data wrangling and preliminary analysis)
### Jupyter Notebooks (for interactive data analysis)
## Dataset Description
The dataset contains data on Olympic Games, including detailed information on the events, athletes, countries, and the medals they won. Below are the key columns in the dataset:

### City: The city where the Olympics took place.
### Year: The year of the Olympics.
### Sport: The sport the event is categorized under.
### Discipline: A subcategory of the sport.
### Event: The specific event within a discipline.
### Athlete: The name of the athlete who participated.
### Gender: The gender of the athlete.
### Country_Code: The country code (abbreviation).
### Country: The full name of the country.
### Event_gender: The gender category of the event (e.g., men’s or women’s).
### Medal: The medal won (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
## Project Objectives
The primary goal of this analysis is to:

### Analyze Trends in Medal Distribution:

Understand how medals are distributed across years, countries, sports, and events.
### Identify Top-Performing Countries and Athletes:

Identify the countries and athletes with the most medals over the years.
### Study the Gender Distribution of Events and Medals:

Examine the representation of men’s and women’s events and their medal distributions.
### Data Visualization:

Use Python libraries (such as Matplotlib and Seaborn) to create visualizations that help us understand the trends in the data.
## Steps and Methodology
### 1. Data Collection
The data used in this project is collected from various Olympic data sources, with columns related to events, athletes, countries, and medals.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and transformed data for analysis.
Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA to understand key trends, distributions, and patterns within the dataset.
Analyzed medal distribution by year, country, sport, and athlete.
### 4. Machine Learning Models
Built machine learning models to predict medal-winning probabilities based on features like athlete gender, sport, event type, and country.
Utilized classification models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression for prediction.
### 5. SQL Queries
Used SQL to query large datasets, especially when working with structured Olympic data in relational databases.
### 6. Data Visualization
Created bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and pie charts to visualize trends and comparisons.
Provided insights on the most successful sports, countries, and athletes.
## Example Visualizations
Medals Over the Years: Line graph showing the total number of medals awarded each year.
Top Countries by Medals: Bar chart displaying the countries with the most medals in specific Olympic years.
Gender Distribution: Pie chart showing the gender breakdown of athletes and medal winners.
